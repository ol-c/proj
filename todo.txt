pipeline to record which references are being watched
    by which client connections, and push changes to clients
    watching reference changes must always be on container
    types since every other type is immutable
        the only container type fro now is a hashmap
client handling of incoming reference changes
since function, reference, and file primatives are wrapped in
    the client, when we reference them from the object command
    line, we need to reset any reference to them to actual
    expected value before they get sent to be saved
set actual requester on web socket connection
    attach requester to socket on connection
    attach requester to each incoming reference as first
        in requester array
more container types: List, Map, Set
save references
save files
