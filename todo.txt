pipeline to record which references are being watched
    most implemented, need to pass connection down chain
    and send unwatch commands when a connection closed
    by which client connections, and push changes to clients
        watching reference changes must always be on container
        types since every other type is immutable
            the only container type for now is a hashmap
set actual requester on web socket connection
    attach requester to socket on connection
    attach requester to each incoming reference as first
        in requester array
more container types: List, Map, Set

save references
save files
