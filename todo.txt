X editing renderers making and showing updates
X render client command line errors
X save references
X resolve references
X save files
X link files to upload and request loop
X expose creating persistant object to command line
X gaurd against circular references to container types
X special "render" field
X     ctrl + e to get into edit mode for object
X special "permissions" field
X associate proper agent for each function so authorize can
X   check permissions
X write all updates into the root file for persist
X layer svg components properly //  trouble rooted in incompatible svg and html rendering pipelines
X List  operations
X persist list operations
X send List operations to watching
X self is a serializable reference to current object
X generic List renderer
X reference renderer
X persistant meta operations on persistant objects
X     owner
X     type
X utility to rebind watching functions to a different reference
X     useful for lists when indices change
X     ... may be useful in future, for now, it is helpful enough
X         to notify watchers of references in an object that a container change occurred
X pass back function to change watching renderer from each function
X queue watch updates and send as group (guaranteed order and better network performance)
X respect self, root and remote reference beginnings (rather than resolving everything to actual ids)
X reference renderer
X expose promises
X     when calling "then" you can provide:
X         a function in a container
X             this will be executed in the container's context
X         a reference to a function to be executed
X         you cannot provide a newly defined function
X             if you could, scoped variables would
X             be hard to manage
X     the generic renderer for a persistant object should
X         show all promises taken out for that object
X             - resolved ones and future ones on delay should render
X             on a timeline
X             - unresolved ones not waiting on a delay should be
X             available near the timeline
X         show the state of the promise
X delay function
X     returns a promise that will resolve after a specified time
X     or at a specified time
X expose modules
X     modules are loaded as soon as they are used and can
X     have a generic renderer that can be seen when inspecting
X     a reference to the module. This renderer should be used for
X     module administration (ex: redis-cli/viewer)
X     modules are exposed via: module.MODULE_NAME
X         need way to restrict require to pull only from specified directory
X make module references persistant
X persist delay function
X    do this by making an optional argument to promise for a
X    time to fulfill the promise if not yet fulfilled
