X pass back function to change watching renderer from each function

  expose promises
      when calling "then" you can provide:
          a function in a container
              this will be executed in the container's context
          a reference to a function to be executed
          you cannot provide a newly defined function
              if you could, scoped variables would
              be hard to manage     
      the generic renderer for a persistant object should
      show all promises taken out for that object
          - resolved ones and future ones on delay should render
          on a timeline
          - unresolved ones not waiting on a delay should be
          available near the timeline

  delay function
      returns a promise that will resolve after a specified time
  expose modules
      modules are loaded as soon as they are used and can
      have a generic renderer that can be seen when inspecting
      a reference to the module. This renderer should be used for
      module administration (ex: redis-cli/viewer)
      modules are exposed via: module.MODULE_NAME
  testing suite
      website that allows users to write tests against the api
      and submit them to the testing framework.
