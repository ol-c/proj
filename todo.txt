X editing renderers making and showing updates

X associate proper agent for each function so authorize can

X     owner

X utility to rebind watching functions to a different reference
X     useful for lists when indices change
X     ... may be useful in future, for now, it is helpful enough
X         to notify watchers of references in an object that a container change occurred
X pass back function to change watching renderer from each function
X queue watch updates and send as group (guaranteed order and better network performance)
X respect self, root and remote reference beginnings (rather than resolving everything to actual ids)
X reference renderer
  expose promises
      when calling "then" you must provide a persistant object
      to be the calling context of the functions
          the generic renderer for an persistant object should
          show all promises taken out for that object
  delay function
      returns a promise that will resolve after a specified time
  expose modules
      modules are loaded as soon as they are used and can
      have a generic renderer that can be seen when inspecting
      a reference to the module. This renderer should be used for
      module administration (ex: redis-cli/viewer)
      modules are exposed via: module.MODULE_NAME
  testing suite
      website that allows users to write tests against the api
      and submit them to the testing framework.
