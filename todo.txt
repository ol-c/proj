pipeline to record which references are being watched
    most implemented, need to pass connection down chain
    and send unwatch commands when a connection closed
    by which client connections, and push changes to clients
        watching reference changes must always be on container
        types since every other type is immutable
            the only container type for now is a hashmap
since function, reference, and file primatives are wrapped in
    the client, when we reference them from the object command
    line, we need to reset any reference to them to actual
    expected value before they get sent to be saved
set actual requester on web socket connection
    attach requester to socket on connection
    attach requester to each incoming reference as first
        in requester array
create container type from front end: Hashmap, List, Map, Set
more container types: List, Map, Set
render client command line errors
save references
save files
client handling of incoming reference changes
client renderers save changes
