X editing renderers making and showing updates
X render client command line errors
X save references
X resolve references
X save files
X link files to upload and request loop
X expose creating persistant object to command line
X gaurd against circular references to container types
X special "render" field
X     ctrl + e to get into edit mode for object
X special "permissions" field
X associate proper agent for each function so authorize can
X   check permissions
X write all updates into the root file for persist
X layer svg components properly //  trouble rooted in incompatible svg and html rendering pipelines
X List  operations
X persist list operations
X send List operations to watching
X self is a serializable reference to current object
X generic List renderer
X reference renderer
X persistant meta operations on persistant objects
X     owner
X     type
X utility to rebind watching functions to a different reference
X     useful for lists when indices change
X     ... may be useful in future, for now, it is helpful enough
X         to notify watchers of references in an object that a container change occurred
X pass back function to change watching renderer from each function
  queue watch updates and send as group (guaranteed order and better network performance)
  respect self, root and remote reference beginnings (rather than resolving everything to actual ids)
  delay function

  how to expose loadable modules
